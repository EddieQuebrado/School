I just made off with your boo dont tell nobody
You took me to paradise
northern lights in your eyes
maybe we can party to a beautiful finally
diamond in the wild west
romeo and juliet yeah
if this ends in disaster and there aint nothin after
we kiss our self orion
and ill do anything to make sure that the lights dont fade
anything to make sure we dont lose this wave
i dont know exactly what the future holds
but even if we lost it all dont lose your dubdubdubudub
